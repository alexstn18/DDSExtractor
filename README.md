# DDSExtractor - .dds texture file extraction and re-importing tool for the PC port of killer7 (and probably No More Heroes too)

**Supported file extensions: .bin, .dat, .sti, .jmb**

In order to get access to such files, please use: https://github.com/Timo654/No-More-RSL

Please beware that this tool may not always work correctly, as the methods that I'm using for extraction and re-importing might not be the best ones. 
I am still working on improving this tool, and I am always open for feedback.

### For an example of usage of the tool, please refer to `EXAMPLE_OF_USAGE.mp4` from either the release, or the actual repository.
